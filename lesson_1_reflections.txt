How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it will highlight the diffrence between the two versions so it makes it easier to spot the missing or added parts

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    if you did some changes to the code you've written and for some reason the code is no longer working so by having an old version saved you can look back and see what made the code break.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    when you commit manually you have the ability to choose the right moment to commit at because sometimes when versions are commited automatically they miss or add a lot of changes which make it harder to navigates through commits and find the right one.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because some files are related between eachother so when you save them in one commit you have the ability to see the changes of all files in one place which makes it easier to deal with problems.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

  	git log shows all the different commits you made and git diff make the difference between to commits by providing their IDs

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because you know that you have a previous version of the code stored that you can look up to if there is a bug introduced with the changes made.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
